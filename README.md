The app supports **Android 2.3.3** and up, with enhanced support for tablet & small screens. It is currently an open beta release. 

Application requires the Android v7 compatibility library & the unoffical [preference fragment library](https://github.com/kolavar/android-support-v4-preferencefragment "android-support-v4-preferencefragment by Kolavar"). Uses resources from [Android Holo Colors Generator](http://android-holo-colors.com/ "Android Holo Colors Generator").

* USD (United State's Dollar)
* CAD (Canadian Dollar)
* EUR (Euro)
* GBP (Great British Pound)
