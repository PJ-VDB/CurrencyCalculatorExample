This old model was an rather old experiment of mine. It contains some more eccentric ways of building and querying the database using `Thread`s, `Handler`s, `HeadlessFragment`s, Data Access Objects (doa), `Parcelable`s, and more.

While I learnt a bit of design it is no longer included in the actual application, in favour of more concise, maintainable code, and serves as old sample code.
